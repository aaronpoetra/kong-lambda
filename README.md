## Create API Gateway using Kong and AWS Lambda

---

In this example, We will create a simple API Gateway using Kong and AWS Lambda.

---

## Components explanation:
- [Kong](https://konghq.com/) is a cloud-native, platform-agnostic, scalable API Gateway distinguished for its high performance and extensibility via plugins. Build on top NGINX and Openresty.

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/getting-started/) is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes
